EduLock — Secure Educational Content Distribution Platform  
 
 
 
Technical Workflow and System Documentation  
 
1. System Overview  
EduLock  is a secure educational content distribution platform designed to prevent unauthorized access, 
sharing, and piracy of digital academic materials. The system ensures that educational files are encrypted, 
access -controlled, and viewable only within a secure  environment.  
The platform uses strong encryption, role -based access control, secure authentication, and device binding to 
protect intellectual property and maintain controlled distribution of educational content.  
 
2.  System Architecture  
EduLock follows a three -tier architecture : 
2.1 Presentation Layer (Frontend)  
• Built using React.js or similar frameworks.  
• Provides teacher and student dashboards.  
• Handles secure file viewing.  
• Sends requests to backend APIs.  
• Prevents unauthorized actions (copy, download, screen capture attempts).  
Components:  
• Login Interface  
• Teacher Dashboard  
• Student Dashboard  
• Secure Content Viewer  
 
2.2 Application Layer (Backend Server)  
• Handles authentication and authorization.  
• Processes file encryption and decryption.  
• Manages classrooms and user roles.  
• Verifies device binding and session validity.  
• Communicates with database and cloud storage.  
Modules:  
• Authentication Service (JWT)  
• File Encryption Service  
• Access Control Manager  
• Key Management Service (KMS)  
• Activity Monitoring System

2.3 Data Layer (Storage & Database)  
• Stores encrypted files.  
• Maintains user data and classroom information.  
• Stores access logs and activity records.  
Storage Components:  
• Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / Firebase)  
• Database (MySQL / MongoDB)  
 
3.  Secure Content Distribution Workflow  
The EduLock system follows a secure multi -step workflow to protect educational content.  
 
3.1 Teacher Content Upload Process  
1. Teacher logs into system using secure authentication.  
2. Teacher uploads educational files (PDF, PPT, Video).  
3. Backend validates file and user permissions.  
4. File is encrypted using AES -256 encryption.  
5. File is converted into proprietary .edulock format.  
6. Encrypted file is stored in cloud storage.  
7. File is mapped to classroom access permissions.  
Outcome:  
Only encrypted content exists in storage.  
 
3.2 Student Content Access Process  
1. Student logs in using institutional credentials.  
2. System verifies identity using JWT authentication.  
3. Student requests file access through secure viewer.  
4. Server checks:  
o Classroom membership  
o Device registration  
o Active session  
5. If authorized, system grants temporary access.  
Outcome:  
Only authorized users proceed to file viewing.

3.3 Secure File Viewing Process  
1. Secure viewer fetches encrypted .edulock file.  
2. Viewer requests temporary decryption key from KMS.  
3. Server verifies access rights.  
4. Server sends short -lived decryption key.  
5. File is decrypted in memory (RAM only).  
6. Content is rendered using secure viewer.  
7. No decrypted file is stored on device.  
Outcome:  
Content remains protected even after access.  
 
4.  Security Mechanisms  
EduLock integrates multiple security layers:  
4.1 Encryption  
• AES-256 encryption for file protection.  
• RSA encryption for key exchange.  
4.2 Authentication  
• JWT-based secure login.  
• Role -based access control (Teacher, Student).  
4.3 Device Binding  
• Content accessible only on registered devices.  
• Prevents forwarding across systems.  
4.4 Secure File Format  
• Proprietary .edulock format.  
• Prevents external file usage.  
4.5 Secure Viewing Environment  
• Right -click disable.  
• Copy -paste restriction.  
• Tab-switch detection.  
• Screen capture protection.  
4.6 Dynamic Watermarking  
• Displays user identity on content.  
• Prevents misuse.  
4.7 Activity Logging  
• Tracks suspicious actions.  
• Records user behavior.

5. Key Management System (KMS)  
The Key Management System controls encryption keys.  
Functions:  
• Generates encryption keys.  
• Issues temporary decryption keys.  
• Verifies user authorization.  
• Revokes access when permissions change.  
Features:  
• Short -lived keys.  
• Secure storage.  
• Automatic key expiration.  
 
6.  Access Control Model  
EduLock uses hierarchical access control.  
Teacher → Classroom → Students  
• Teachers manage classroom membership.  
• Students access only assigned content.  
• Permissions dynamically updated.  
7. System Components  
7.1 User Management System  
• User registration and authentication.  
• Role assignment.  
7.2 Classroom Management  
• Create classroom groups.  
• Assign students.  
7.3 File Processing Module  
• File encryption.  
• Format conversion.  
7.4 Secure Viewer  
• Displays protected content.  
• Prevents external storage.  
7.5 Monitoring System  
• Tracks usage and security violations.  
 
8. Conclusion  
EduLock  provides a comprehensive solution for secure educational content distribution by integrating 
encryption, access control, and secure viewing technologies. The platform ensures content protection, EduLock — Secure Educational Content Distribution Platform  
 
 
controlled access, and improved digital learning security, making it highly suitable for modern educational 
institutions.   
 
Screen shot of the prototype:  
• POST /encrypt : The Teacher Upload Handler . It accepts raw files (PDF/Video), applies AES-256 encryption , 
and saves them in the protected .edulock  format.  
• POST /generate -token/{filename} : The Key Management (KMS)  endpoint. It generates a short -lived, one -
time access token for a specific file, ensuring that links cannot be shared or reused.  
• GET /stream/{token} : The Secure Viewer Endpoint . It accepts the valid token, decrypts the content in 
memory (RAM), and streams it in chunks  to the frontend (preventing full file downloads).
